* Download [installer here](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/download/v2.3.2/Computator.NET.Installer.v2.3.2.exe)
* Download [portable version (*.zip) here](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/download/v2.3.2/Computator.NET.v2.3.2.zip)
* For Windows XP [download portable version (*.zip) here](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/download/v2.3.2/Computator.NET.v2.3.2-WindowsXP.zip)


# Installation & Setup
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH43GHS?ocid=badge"><img width="25%" src="https://assets.windowsphone.com/f2f77ec7-9ba9-4850-9ebe-77e366d08adc/English_Get_it_Win_10_InvariantCulture_Default.png" alt="Get it on Windows 10" /></a>
1. This project requires **.NET Framework** version [**4.0 Full**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17718) on Windows XP and version [**4.6.1**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49982) on newer systems.
2. Go to [latest release page](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/releases/latest)
3. Now you can download either portable version (the one with .zip extension) or installer (the one with .exe extension). In general, installer is recommended, because it sets up tsl and tslf files extensions for Computator.NET in registry.
4. If you downloaded portable version, just unzip it into location you want to store and you are ready to go.
5. If you downloaded version with installer, just click on the installer file, it will guide you through the whole process and download all required files and libraries.
6. After installation or unzip, if you want to run it, simply click on Computator.NET.exe (or Computator.NET shortcut on desktop if you had chosen installer) in whatever location you had chosen for it.

##### Development
* This repo supports **Fork & Pull Model**, you can do any useful changes and when you are done make a pull request. If your work is of good quality, it will be included in main branch.
* List of **things to do** is **updated constantly**, you can view it here: [TODO file](../master/TODO). Choose wisely because some of those things are way harder than it looks.
* List of known bugs and issues is here: [**issues**](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/issues).
* Our **unit tests coverage is small**, partly because of the fact that there is good chunk of UI code here. Still I am afraid that there are lots and lots of not found bugs. If you want to help us fix those bugs, first try to catch them by **writing good unit tests**.

##### Users
* If **you have found ANY bugs** or you think something might be bug please report it in [**issues**](https://github.com/PawelTroka/Computator.NET/issues) as fast as you can. Any help with testing / finding bugs is greatly appreciated.

# FAQ

### What shortcut do you use to write in exponent, just like in gif presentation?

LShift+6 (^), just like it is listed in **Edit** menu from where you can also **activate / deactivate** writing in exponent without using this shortcut.

### How can I solve equations / do my homework using Computator.NET?

Computator.NET is numerical software that aims to provide functionality similar to Matlab and Mathematica. But it certainly isn't full Computer Algebra System, at least not yet. You can solve some equations by using '**Numerical calculations**' tab and '**Function root**' operation. Depending on the equation, different methods work better or worse.
![Solving equations using numerical calculations](../master/Graphics/Presentation/solving%20equations%20using%20numerical%20calculations.gif "Solving equations using numerical calculations")
Alternatively, you can always solve equations graphically, simply by looking at the chart.
