I've been creating this library since 2017 for my university homework and firts job. Writing it I was practicing my C# skills from c# 3.0 to C# 7.1, getting coding experience.

There are .NET Framework version and newest supported .NET Core (named MathClassesLibrary) copy with few upgrading.

See some examples of using and results [here](https://github.com/PasaOpasen/Old_Math_CSharpCpp_Projects)
