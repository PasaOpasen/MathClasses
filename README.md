# Math Classes in CSharp

## About

Set of simple mathematical classes in C# including

* Vectors (with complex cases)
* Matrixes (not only square)
* Polynoms (including intergation and derivatives)
* Systems of linear equations
* Integrals methods (including Gauss-Kronrod)
* Complex numbers, complex vectors, matrixes and methods for complex functions
* Rational numbers
* Graphs 
* Methods for solving simple differential equations
* Function approximation/interpolation
* Function optimization (including swarm algorithm for 1/2/n dimentions)
* Function values memorising (memoize) for parallel/non-parallel cases 

I've been creating this library since 2017 for my university homework and firts job. Writing it I was practicing my C# skills from C# 3.0 to C# 7.1, getting coding experience.

There are .NET Framework version and newest supported .NET Core (named MathClassesLibrary) copy with few upgrading.

See some examples of using and results [here](https://github.com/PasaOpasen/Old_Math_CSharpCpp_Projects)
